description: A comprehensive guide to Refact.ai's Autonomous Agent feature.
---

The Autonomous Agent is an advanced AI capability that allows Refact to independently handle complex coding tasks. Unlike traditional AI assistants that require constant interaction, the Autonomous Agent can understand context, plan steps, and execute multiple actions to achieve your desired outcome.

## Key Features

### Autonomous Decision Making
The Agent can:
- Analyze project structure and context
- Plan necessary steps to complete a task
- Make informed decisions about which files to modify
- Execute multiple related changes across files
- Verify its own work and make corrections

### Context-Aware Operations
The Agent utilizes:
- Full project structure understanding
- Code dependencies analysis
- Existing patterns in your codebase
- Documentation and comments
- Version control history

### Self-Verification
The Agent includes built-in verification mechanisms:
- Syntax checking before applying changes
- Consistency verification across modifications
- Integration with existing code patterns
- Automatic error detection and correction

## Usage Scenarios

### Code Refactoring
The Agent excels at complex refactoring tasks:
- Renaming symbols across multiple files
- Restructuring code architecture
- Updating API implementations
- Converting between coding patterns

### Feature Implementation
Can handle end-to-end feature additions:
- Creating new components or modules
- Implementing specified functionality
- Adding necessary tests
- Updating documentation

### Code Analysis and Fixes
Autonomous problem-solving for:
- Bug identification and fixes
- Performance optimizations
- Security vulnerability patches
- Code style consistency

## How to Use

### Starting the Agent
1. Open the AI Chat in Agent Mode
2. Describe your task in natural language
3. The Agent will:
   - Analyze the requirements
   - Plan necessary steps
   - Execute the changes
   - Verify the results

### Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear requirements and expected outcomes
- **Review Changes**: While the Agent is autonomous, review its proposed changes
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use follow-up requests to refine results if needed
